It's image processing project using matlab tool including:
1-Convert between differnt types of images:
  1.from rgb to binary.
  2.from rgb to gray.
  3.from gray to binary.
  
2-Perform Point Processing on image including:
  -change the brightness of image:
        1.lighten image through add or multiply a constant in pixels of image.
        2.darken image  through substract or divide a constant from pixels of image.
        
3-Perfom basic Transformation :
  1. Linear Functions:
  • Negative Transformation.
  • Identity Transformation.
  2. Logarithmic Functions:
  • Log Transformation
  • Inverse-log Transformation.
  3. Power-Law Functions:
  • nth power transformation.
  • nth root transformation.
  
4-How to enhance an image using different filters in both spatial and frequency domain whether smooting or sharpening filters.

5-Filtering in Spatial Domain:
  -Smoothing filters inculding both linear and non-linear filters:
      1.linear Filters:
            - Averaging filter.
            - Weighted averaging filter.
      2.Nonlinear Filters (Order-Statistic Filters):
            -Minimum filters (suited for salt noise).
            - Maximum filters (suited for pepper noise).
            - Median filters (suited for salt and pepper noise).
  -Sharpening Filters:
              1. Laplacian Mask.
              2.Unsharp Mask.
              3.High Boost.
              4. Sobel(vertical ,horizental,right-diagnol,left-diagnol).
              
6-Filtering in Frequency Domain:
      -Fourier Transform and inverse Fourier Transform.
      -Low pass & High pass filters in Frequency Domain:
            1.low pass (Smoothing filters):
                    1.1) Ideal lowpass filters (very sharp).
                    1.2) Butterworth lowpass filters.
                    1.3) Gaussian lowpass filters (very smooth).
            2.High pass(Sharpening filters):
                    2.1) Ideal High pass filters.
                    2.2) Butterworth High pass filters.
                    2.3) Gaussian High pass filters.
                    
7-Adding noise to image with its different types:
                    1. Gaussian.
                    2.Rayleigh.
                    3.Erlang.
                    4. Exponential
                    5.Uniform.
                    6.Impulse(Salt and pepper noise).
